# shell4kbin
This Android app is a webview shell for the kbin.social site.

Is a dedicated browser for the kbin.social site: once you open the app you will see the kbin.social site as you would see it in any browser.
But, if you want, you can install JS and CSS code to change the appearance and functionality of the site.

I created this application to be able to use the kbin.social site in a browser other than the default browser; I share it in case it might be useful to others.
