# shell4kbin
This Android app is a webview shell for the kbin.social site.
This app is simply a dedicated browser for the kbin.social site: once you open the app you will see the kbin.social site as you would see it in any browser.
I created this app for myself, because I wanted to interact with the kbin.social site in a browser other than the default browser on my phone, and I am sharing it in case it might be useful to others.
